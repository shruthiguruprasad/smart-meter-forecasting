# 📚 Smart Meter Forecasting - Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Smart Meter Forecasting project! This folder contains comprehensive guides and references for working with the codebase.

## 📋 Documentation Overview

### 🔧 [Feature Engineering Guide](feature_engineering_guide.md)
**Comprehensive guide to the feature engineering system**
- 80+ carefully designed features for electricity consumption forecasting
- Detailed breakdown of all feature categories
- Usage examples and research applications
- Support for 3-stage research framework (Stage 0: EDA, Stage 1: Day-ahead, Stage 2: Multi-horizon)

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Read the Feature Engineering Guide** to understand the comprehensive feature system
2. **Follow the usage examples** to implement features in your research
3. **Use feature groups** for organized model interpretation and SHAP analysis

## 🎯 Research Framework Support

Our documentation aligns with the **3-stage research approach**:

- **Stage 0**: Exploratory & Predictive Modeling (XGBoost + SHAP feature importance)
- **Stage 1**: Day-ahead forecasting (1-day horizon)
- **Stage 2**: Multi-horizon forecasting (1 week, 1 month)

## 📊 Feature Categories Covered

✅ **Consumption Features**: Core electricity usage patterns  
✅ **Temporal Features**: Calendar effects and seasonality  
✅ **Weather Features**: Environmental factors and degree days  
✅ **Time Series Features**: Lags, rolling windows, and trends  
✅ **Household Features**: ACORN and socio-economic factors  
✅ **Interaction Features**: Complex feature combinations  

## 🔍 For Researchers
